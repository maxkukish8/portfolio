    <p>Hey, I’m Maksym,<br>
      a Front-End Developer from Kyiv.<br>
      I’ve worked on projects ranging<br>
      from custom Magento themes<br>
      to modern Vue.js and React applications.<br>
      I love blending creativity<br>
      with technical precision,<br>
      building web experiences<br>
      that are both beautiful and functional.<br>
      My goal is to create interfaces<br>
      that feel effortless, intuitive,<br>
      and enjoyable for every user.</p>
